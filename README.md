Scriptian is a lightweight CLI tool built in Rust that helps you run and manage
scripts in any language, from anywhere in your filesystem. Whether you're using
Bash, PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, or something else, Scriptian makes it
easy to execute your scripts from a central location‚Äîwithout worrying about what
language they're written in.

### <a id="motivation"></a>üí° Motivation

I started working on Scriptian because I needed an easy way to run some Python
scripts I wrote to automate tasks for university.

Even though I added the directory with my scripts to the PATH environment variable,
I could only open them in my editor ‚Äî running them with the interpreter required
typing out their full paths.

At the same time, I wanted to learn a new language for building CLI tools since
I spend so much time in the terminal. Rust seemed like a great fit, so I figured
this would be the perfect opportunity to kill two birds with one stone ‚Äî learn
Rust and solve my problem at the same time. :)
